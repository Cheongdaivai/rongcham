# AI Voice Control Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the AI-powered voice control features for your RongCham restaurant system.

## Prerequisites

1. **Supabase Account**: Your database should already be configured
2. **Google AI Studio Account**: Required for Gemini AI integration
3. **Modern Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, or Safari with Web Speech API support

## Step 1: Get Gemini API Key

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create a new API key:
   - Click "Get API key"
   - Choose "Create API key in new project" or select existing project
   - Copy the generated API key

## Step 2: Environment Configuration

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Add your Gemini API key to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

3. Restart your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Step 3: Browser Permissions

When you first use voice control:

1. Your browser will ask for microphone permission
2. Click "Allow" to enable voice recognition
3. The voice control panel will show "ðŸŽ¤ Ready" when activated

## Step 4: Using AI Voice Control

### Activation
- Click "Start Listening" in the AI Voice Control panel
- Say "Hey restaurant" to activate voice commands
- The system will respond with "Voice control activated"

### Natural Language Commands

The AI understands natural speech patterns. You can say:

#### Order Management
- "Mark order 123 as done"
- "Please set order 456 to preparing"
- "Cancel order 789"
- "Complete order 234"

#### Order Queries
- "How many pending orders do we have?"
- "Show me the preparing orders"
- "What's our order status right now?"

#### Menu Analytics
- "What are our most popular dishes?"
- "Show me the best selling items"
- "Which menu items are available?"

#### Help
- "What can you do?"
- "Help me with commands"

### Voice Responses

The system will:
- âœ… Speak confirmations back to you
- ðŸŽ¯ Show confidence levels for each command
- ðŸ“Š Display real-time data updates
- ðŸ”„ Auto-refresh the dashboard

## Features

### ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Understanding
- **Natural Language**: Speak normally, no rigid commands
- **Context Awareness**: AI understands your restaurant's current state
- **Smart Responses**: Contextual confirmations and information

### ðŸŽ¤ Voice Recognition
- **Keyword Activation**: "Hey restaurant" to start
- **Continuous Listening**: Stays active for 30 seconds
- **Auto-Deactivation**: Saves battery and privacy

### ðŸ”Š Speech Synthesis
- **Voice Confirmations**: Hear responses spoken back
- **Toggle Audio**: Mute/unmute voice responses
- **Pleasant Voice**: Uses optimal speech synthesis settings

### ðŸ“Š Real-time Integration
- **Live Updates**: Changes reflect immediately in dashboard
- **Database Sync**: All voice commands update the database
- **Multi-user**: Works alongside manual dashboard updates

## Troubleshooting

### "API key not found" Error
- Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
- Restart your development server after adding the key
- Verify the API key is valid in Google AI Studio

### Voice Recognition Not Working
- Ensure you're using Chrome, Firefox, or Safari
- Check microphone permissions in browser settings
- Try speaking more clearly or closer to the microphone

### AI Not Understanding Commands
- Speak clearly and at normal pace
- Include context like order numbers or specific actions
- Check the confidence level - low confidence may need rephrasing

### No Voice Responses
- Click the ðŸ”Š button to enable speech synthesis
- Check browser audio settings
- Some browsers require user interaction before playing audio

## API Usage and Costs

### Gemini API Pricing
- Free tier: 15 requests per minute
- Paid tier: Higher rate limits available
- Voice commands typically use 1-2 API calls each

### Rate Limiting
- The system includes fallback processing if API limits are reached
- Basic keyword matching works without AI as backup

## Security Notes

### API Key Protection
- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side access only
- Consider server-side API calls for production

### Voice Data
- Voice processing happens in browser (not sent to our servers)
- Only transcribed text is sent to Gemini AI
- No audio recordings are stored

## Production Deployment

### Environment Variables
Set these in your production environment:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_production_api_key
```

### HTTPS Required
- Voice recognition requires HTTPS in production
- Ensure your hosting platform supports SSL

### Browser Compatibility
- Test voice features across target browsers
- Provide fallback UI for unsupported browsers
